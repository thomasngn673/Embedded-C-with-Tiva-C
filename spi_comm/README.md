This file demonstrates SPI communication between the Tiva C and Arduino with the Tiva C being the master and Arduino being the slave.
Master signal is interfaced across port D while data is transmitted via PF2. 
Bug/File Error: Blue LED connected at Arduino digital pin 7 does not emit val2 'B'. The Serial monitor constantly reads 'A'.
